# GESAH Graphic Arts Ontology
The GESAH Graphic Art Ontology is designed for the inventory, classification and structured description of works on paper.

## Goals
The ontology serves for the inventory, classification and structured description of works on paper. It is capable of mapping changing attributions to artists, complex events, such as the often multi-phase creation of an art work or its provenance history, as well as of recording inscriptions, collector's marks, and other features in a structured way. The goals are easy access to the material for the public, scholarly indexing by the specialist community and curatorial documentation by the preserving institution.
